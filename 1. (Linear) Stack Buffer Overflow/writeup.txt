First we would use ida to find out the address of the vuln fn, which is 401460.

then use metasploit pattern to check out the offset that we need.

afterthat we place the address into the return value. Then we can go into the if clause.

Based on the metasploit pattern, we know that the return address is at 112th character. so we put the address there to get the soln.
