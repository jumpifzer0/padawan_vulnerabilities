First use ida to find out the function pointers of the values:
what we are concerned is function0, function1 and function2.
The addresses of these functions are: 0x401460,0x401498, 0x4014c4 and 0x4014f0.
Based on the code, we can only place positive numbers.
So to jump to the necessary functions, we can use the binary form of the negative number to perform the jumps.

First we calculate that the difference between main and function2 has a difference of 0x2C, so we would need to create the value of negative 0x2C, and the positive value of the binary, which is 212.
Then from function2 to function 1 is the same.
Lastly is from function1 to function0, which has a difference of 0x38 so we would need to create the value of negative -0x38, and the positive value of binary, which is 200.

With that challenge has been completed.
