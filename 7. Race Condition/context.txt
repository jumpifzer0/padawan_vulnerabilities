The goal of this challenge is to make use of race condition vulnerability to "buy" more items than the allowed amount. 
With this vulnerability, it would be possible to purchase more items given the 100 starting tokens. 
The token will only be consumed when the item is created and therefore there would be a TOCTOU problem.

Get at least 500 items so that flag can then be printed on the console.
